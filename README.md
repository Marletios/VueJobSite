# Vue Job Board Prototype

A simple job board front-end built with **Vue 3** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed directly from my Figma wireframes.  

This is the foundation for a full-stack project where Iâ€™ll later integrate an **AdonisJS backend** to serve real job listings.

## âœ¨ Features (so far)
- Responsive **navigation bar** with mobile hamburger menu
- **Hero section** with bold, centered headline
- Two **info cards** (For Developers / For Employers)
- **Job listings section** with styled cards (job type, title, description, salary, apply button)
- Clean **footer** with links and copyright
- Fully responsive for both desktop and mobile

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) (frontend framework)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (fast dev/build tool)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (utility-first styling)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
- Connect to an **AdonisJS API backend**
- Dynamically fetch job data instead of using sample content
- Add search and filtering functionality
- Enhance styling with Tailwind components and transitions

## ðŸ“¸ Design
Based on Figma wireframes for **desktop** and **mobile** layouts.
